In this paper, the heart was visualized in three-dimensional space in order to provide the user with the sufficient intuition in computer-aided surgical simulation for the training of the PCI procedure. %
Though not interacting directly, the silhouette of the heart model can provide the users a reference of the spatial relationship between different branches of the coronary vasculature. %

As the future plan, the data decimation is definitely of the first priority in the heart modeling.
Besides, the further smoothing of the resultant surface is also indispensable.
